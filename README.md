# How to make changes
You have to already have HYDE installed. If you don't, go here: github.com/hyde/hyde, and get the test site working.

1. Download this repo as a zip, and extract the files (or just clone the repo using git/github desktop).
2. Edit the files.
3. Open a powershell/cmd window in the CMS directory.
4. Run "hyde gen" to generate the website.
5. Run "hyde serve" to host the website at http://localhost:8080/
To test changes, run the "hyde gen" command from the CMS directory.

* Next, submit the changes you've made by pushing them to github. If you don't know how, download github desktop, and follow instructions here https://services.github.com/on-demand/github-desktop/push-with-github-desktop. Or we can just setup a google drive if that's easier.

# CMS/Content
Contains the HTML markup for the site.

# CMS/Layout
Contains javascript files that control the layout and look of the site.
